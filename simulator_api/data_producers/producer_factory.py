    A factory class for creating producers using registered builders.

    This class allows you to register builder functions for creating specific
    types of producers and then create instances of those producers using the
    registered builders.

    Note :
    ** Builders here are used to build objects that have different initiation methods instead of using if else conditions in the
    factory class

    Attributes:
    - _builders (dict): A dictionary that maps keys to builder functions.
